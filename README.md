# Parsource

Parsource is a cherry-picking parser for source code that is able to
generate documentation, tags and other useful information. It sits somewhere
halfway between CTags and a full language parser.

By default, Parsource supports the following languages:

-   JavaScript
-   Python

But it is easy to add your own.

-   [NaturalDocs](https://www.naturaldocs.org/reference/scope/)
-   [Rosie Pattern Language](ht tps://rosie-lang.org/)
-   Cherry picking parsing: skip over chunks of text and parse the contentsâ€¦ or not!
